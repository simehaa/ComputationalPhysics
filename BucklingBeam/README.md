# Project 2
## Files
### Makefile
Which allows for an easy compile, run:
```
> make -j
> ./test.x
```
(the -j option compiles the .cpp files parallel).
### Three c++ files:
* main.cpp - will call the test_functions and functions to perform Jacobi's algorithm and write files
* functions.cpp
* test_functions.cpp
### Python file
Simple script that reads the data files and plots it.
### Header files
For functions.cpp and test_functions.cpp
